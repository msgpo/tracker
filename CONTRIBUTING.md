# [Contributing to Turtl](https://turtlapp.com/contributing/)

Thanks for wanting to help make the Turtl project better!

## Submitting an issue?

Head to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/turtl/tracker/issues).

## Want to help out?

Check out our [contribution guide](https://turtlapp.com/contributing/) and if
everything looks good, see our [list of items we could use help on](https://github.com/turtl/tracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A%2A+label%3Astatus%3Ahelp-wanted).

This includes all issues with the `help-wanted` tag that are a part of a
milestone. Issues that have not been assigned a milestone are unplanned, meaning
we may not want to include them in the project at all and they exist only to
document potential ideas.

*Be very careful working on issues that do not have a milestone!* You may submit
a pull request just to find we aren't going to merge it. When in doubt, ask us!

## Ready to submit a PR?

If you haven't read the [contribution guide](https://turtlapp.com/contributing/)
yet, please go over it.

If your PR is more than a few lines of code, we will ask you to
[sign the CLA](https://turtlapp.com/contributing/#sign-the-contributor-license-agreement).

Once that's all done, we welcome your changes!
