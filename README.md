# Turtl project tracker

This repo exists to track all bugs, issues, features requests, and status for
the entire Turtl project.

The idea is that many times, users/issue reporters don't know which repo to open
the issue on or where to look for project status. This is the attempt to solve
this problem by centralizing everything into one place.
